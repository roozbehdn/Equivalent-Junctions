# Equivalent-Junctions

This repository contains the python scripts that can be used to extarct equivalent junctions from transcriptome. README_eq_junc provides more details on how to
run the scripts and get the summary of equivalnt junctions.


getJunctionsFromTxt.py: Determines equivalent junction sequences from a genome fasta file and annotatiaon file in the BED format containing chr, donor, and acceptor coordinates.
